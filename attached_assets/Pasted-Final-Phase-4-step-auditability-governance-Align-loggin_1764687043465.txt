Final Phase 4 step: auditability + governance. Align logging/monitoring with NIST 800-53 audit controls and your internal GOJ cybersecurity expectations.

Goal: Ensure DMIS has:

Clear security/audit log coverage for key events.

Basic monitoring hooks.

Documented controls (for your security/governance pack).

Step 1 – Identify key security events

List or mark in code where the following events occur:

User login success/failure

Password reset / account changes (if applicable)

Role/privilege changes

Creation/update of: donations, donation intake, transfers, relief requests, relief packages, dispatches

For each, confirm that:

A log entry is written at INFO or WARN level (but no secrets included).

It includes at least: timestamp, user ID, action, target entity (ID), and outcome.

If any are missing, add structured log statements using a consistent format.

Step 2 – Add a simple “security logger” helper

Create a helper function (or logger wrapper) to standardize security/audit logs, e.g.:

import logging  
 
security_logger = logging.getLogger("dmis.security")  
 
def log_security_event(action, user_id=None, details=None):  
    security_logger.info(  
        "action=%s user_id=%s details=%s",  
        action,  
        user_id,  
        sanitize_for_log(details),  # reuse helper from Phase 3  
    )  


Use this for key events, rather than ad-hoc strings.

Step 3 – Basic monitoring hooks

Add a short MONITORING.md or a section in SECURITY.md describing:

What logs should be ingested by a SIEM (e.g., DMIS app logs, NGINX logs).

What basic alerts should be configured:

High number of failed logins.

Repeated access to forbidden routes.

Unusual volume of donation/dispatch changes.

This is documentation only in this repo; actual SIEM configuration will be done on the infra side.

Step 4 – Security governance artefacts (text only)

Provide templates or skeletons (Markdown or simple docs in /docs) for:

Security Architecture Diagram description – list components and trust boundaries (web, app, DB, external donors/agencies, admin users).

Threat Model summary – key threats and mitigations (SQLi, XSS, privilege escalation, tampering, data loss).

Security Controls Matrix – mapping:

App controls (input validation, RBAC, logging).

Infrastructure controls (NGINX, TLS, firewall, WAF).

Process controls (code review, SAST, dependency scanning).

These can be Markdown files in docs/security/ that you or the security team can refine.
